# Robotic-Arm
In this program as an electrical engineer, I was responsible of connect the circuit inside the arm. The circuit of the arm consists of servo motors that were programmed by Arduino.
First I made the motors go to angle 90, then they came back to their initial position (0 degrees). After that I programmed the motors to be controlled by a potentiometer.
